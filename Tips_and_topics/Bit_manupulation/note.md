# ((n & (n - 1)) == 0)

---

it means that when we do and operation
with (n-1) then if answer is zero that means n= `2*k` where k is even number

# (n& -n) then all set bit is gone

other than the last set bit

like for 11 - 1011

        - 11- 0101
           --------
                  1

only the last set is preserve

>> int x = \_\_builtin_ctz(a[i]);  how many steps it takes to convert a even number to odd number dividing by two
